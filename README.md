# Goodreads_Kaggle_project

#Overview

First of all, we will mention a bit about the owner of this dataset, Goodreads . Goodreads is a social cataloging website that allows individuals to freely search its database of books, annotations, and reviews.

This project aims to have an insight about different numerical parameters of the book and their relationship. Moreoever, alongside with the informaion given, we try to do a bit of web-scrapping and get another attribute (in this case, 'Year') in order to take our analysis further. Moreover, this would be my first milestone into Data Analysis, using all the skills and knowledges I have acquired during my summer time working with R.

This project is made possible by user **Soumik** on Kaggle, along with the wonderful reference from the Python notebook named **Goodreads: Analysis and Recommending Books** of *Shivam Ralli*. I would like to send my sincere thanks to both of them.

All of the datasets and scripts used will be uploaded along with this notebook. 

#Structure

This project includes the following parts:

  * Notebook .Rmd: including all the analysis of the datasets on R. 
  * File .nb.html: output file of the notebook .Rmd above, under the type of html
  * webscrapping_year.py: Pythons script to scrap 'Year' attribute data from different sources, both from Goodreads API and from the isbn library of python. 
  * books.csv: The original Goodreads data on Kaggle
  * goodreads_year.csv: The data exported from webscrapping_year.py
  
 I hope you will enjoy this project as much as I do! If you have any message or comment, please do not hesitate to contact me via \email{hoang-anh.ngo@polytechnique.edu}. Any of your response will be much appreciated.
